# UltimateMegaSuperBomberManOfTheDead

Simple game project with ambitious gameplay.
2 local player Coop & Versus

Each players play only on one half of the screen, one in the upper half, the second in the lower half.
There'll be differents game modes but they'll pretty much all consist of the two players making passes with a bomb.

The default game mode consist of a non stopping scrolling background where the players need to pass themselves the bomb without making it explode,
in order to progress through the level.
